Allison was born and raised in Sarnia, Ontario. Following high school, Allison completed 7.5 years of post-secondary education. Prior to pursuing her specialization in Chiropody, Allison obtained an Honours Specialization in Kinesiology (BA) from Western University. Allison has always been very passionate about health, fitness, and athletics, having a particular passion for running. It was through her own pursuit in athletics that she sustained a running-related injury that introduced her to the field of podiatric medicine. It was through this experience that she gained an appreciation for the endless wear and tear our feet are subjected to and saw the benefits of chiropody services. This led Allison to complete the Chiropody program at the Michener (UHN) from which she graduated with distinction. During her time studying chiropody, Allison was chosen to be a peer tutor, working as a student resident in the Michener Chiropody Clinic in downtown Toronto, mentoring lower year chiropody students. Allison has a particular interest in sports medicine, biomechanics, and diabetic footcare/education.

Allison is always continuing her education and learning new techniques that allow her to create individualized treatment plans constructed on evidence-based research to ensure practical patient-centred care.

In her free time Allison enjoys traveling to new places, spending time with friends and family, staying active/working out, and trying out new food/restaurants. Allison is also the (very) proud owner of her fur-baby Frank, the goldendoodle.
