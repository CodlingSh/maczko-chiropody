Chelsea Charteris is a 2018 graduate from the Chiropody program at The Michener Institute of Education gaining both Honours and the silver award for academic excellence, as well as mentoring and tutoring her follow peers throughout the program.

Before pursuing more education, she originally went to the University of Guelph graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours in Human Kinetics. This allowed Chelsea to gain experience in the physiotherapy field where she worked as an assistant to physiotherapy treatments in both private practice and long-term care. It was through this line of work she found a passion for health care and saw the demand in foot health and education needed in her hometown. She has a keen interest on how feet impact the human biomechanics of everyday life and specific sports, and pediatric cases on proper foot development.

In addition to her chiropody interests, Chelsea is a sports enthusiast who from a young age, and to this day, still plays a variety of sports like basketball and volleyball. She was born and raised in Sarnia, Ontario and has started her own growing family with her husband, daughter, and many furry children.
