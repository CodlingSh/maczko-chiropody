Heels may become painful for numerous reasons. Shoes that are worn out or poorly fitted are often the main cause of callus with cracks/fissures and blisters on the back of the heel, or bursitis at the attachment of the Achilles tendon to the calcaneus (heel bone). Other painful heel conditions include: Achilles Tendonitis; Heel Spurs, Haglundâ€™s Deformity (pump bumps) and Plantar Fasciitis. A biomechanical evaluation is often necessary to determine the cause of painful heels and to provide a treatment plan to resolve/control it.
