Is a common deformity of the foot affecting the big toe area. They may become very painful if a persons footwear creates abnormal pressure. Bunions are often inherited and more common with women than men. Persons with bunions or believe they are developing bunions should have a biomechanical examination to determine appropriate forms of treatment. Options may include: education; proper fitting footwear; footwear modifications; orthotics; or surgery if conservative treatments do not control or reduce pain.
