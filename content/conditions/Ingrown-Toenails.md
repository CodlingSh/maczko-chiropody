A common, painful condition usually affecting the big toe or second toe. It is often caused by poor nail cutting techniques; nail deformities i.e.: curling at the edges; improper footwear or poor hygiene. Persons who develop “ingrowing” nails or painful nails should seek assistance from a Chiropodist to determine its cause and to treat/resolve the problem. Diabetes and persons with poor circulation are susceptible to serious infection and should seek help immediately to prevent further complications. Occasionally, permanent nail surgery may be required.
