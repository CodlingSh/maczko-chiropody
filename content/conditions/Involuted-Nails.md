Involuted nails are toenails that curve inwards on one or both sides of the nail. They may become very painful or infected as the nail bed is often pinched causing a reduction of blood flow. Chiropodial assessments and treatments are necessary to determine their cause and to control/eliminate associated pain or infections. Chiropodial treatments are usually painless.
