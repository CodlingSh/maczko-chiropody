The bodyâ€™s defense response to abnormal friction or pressure to the skin. This is usually caused by foot deformities; improper footwear; or postural imbalances of the foot. Corns may develop at the location where the pressure or stress is excessive. They are often painful and may become infected. A biomechanical assessment to determine the cause and chiropodial treatments are required to control or resolve these lesions.
