Feet that have high medial longitudinal arches. Approximately 13% of the population has this foot type. Unfortunately most high arch people will develop foot or foot related problems due to its inability to deal with the mechanical shock associated with foot strike to hard flat surfaces. Persons with high arches should have a biomechanical assessment to learn how to prevent or resolve/control painful symptoms if they develop. Shock absorbing footwear and soft orthotics are often necessary to control symptoms.
