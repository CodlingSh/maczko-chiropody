These are feet with little or no medial longitudinal arches. Approximately 30% of adults have flat feet. Commonly they develop due to loose or stretchy ligaments (the wires that connect our bones together) and may cause symptoms of sore, tired, aching feet, legs, knees, hips or spine. If a person is concerned about their flat feet, they should have a biomechanical assessment. Many people do not have any complaints with their flat feet and they usually do not require treatment. Those who do suffer with pain, etc. may benefit from the use of better shoes, arch supports or orthotics.
