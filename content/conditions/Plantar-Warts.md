They are a viral infection which may enter the skin through cuts or cracks. Plantar warts occur on the feet and often grow inwards due to pressure from walking or standing. They usually enlarge, multiply and become painful if left untreated because we walk on them. They look “spongy”, have a cauliflower appearance, and often have “black spots” that represent broken microscopic blood vessels (capillaries); often thought to be roots (there are no roots!). Sometimes they can be mistaken as calluses or corns. A Chiropodial assessment should be considered to determine the best course of treatment i.e. acids, liquid nitrogen or a prescribed cream.
