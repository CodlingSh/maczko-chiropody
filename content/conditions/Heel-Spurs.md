Are created by deposits of bone-like calcium on the heel bone at the insertion of the plantar fascia to the heel bone (calcaneus). It often develops as a result of a tear of the plantar fascia ligament near the front of the heel bone. The body lays down the calcium to strengthen the bond of the plantar fascia or to reattach it if a tear occurs. Spurs usually do not cause pain in this situation. Pain is usually caused by the inflammation associated with plantar fasciitis. A biomechanical assessment and possibly x-rays may be needed to determine the proper treatment options to control/resolve the pain.
