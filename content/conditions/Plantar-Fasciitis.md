Often it is worse in the morning when a person rises out of bed or upon standing after sitting. The plantar fascia is a ligament that helps to form the medial longitudinal arch and it becomes inflamed due to abnormal or excessive stress created during heel strike when walking, running or standing. Swelling occurs deep inside the heel which causes pressure on the nerves in the region causing minor to severe pain while weight bearing.

A biomechanical examination is important to determine the cause of this condition so that proper treatment can occur to resolve this debilitating problems.
