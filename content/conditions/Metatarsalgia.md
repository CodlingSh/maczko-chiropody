A general term describing “a pain in the ball of the foot” (metatarsal heads). It is usually created by excessive, unnatural pressure to the metatarsal heads causing inflammation. Symptoms may include: aching; burning; swelling; calluses and corns. Diseases, trauma, poor quality footwear, aging and hard surfaces must be considered when treating this problem. Pain relief is usually achieved with proper chiropodial care and shoe modifications.
