A condition where the toes are drawn up towards the ball of the foot. This forces the metatarsal head downwards towards the ground. This will often cause pressure lesions i.e. calluses/corns on the top of the toes (if they rub against the shoe toebox) or on the ball of the foot if excessive friction occurs. If symptoms develop, relief of pain can be achieved by internal shoe modifications; protective padding; chiropodial treatments; and/or orthotics.
