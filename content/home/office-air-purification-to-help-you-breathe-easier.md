For everyone’s safety, we have installed three state of the art “Clean Air Purification” systems located in each treatment room. They continuously eliminate bacteria, fungus, and viruses through large carbon filters and ultraviolet lighting system. This allows both the patient and practitioner breathe in “cleaner” air while eliminating odor-causing particles.
