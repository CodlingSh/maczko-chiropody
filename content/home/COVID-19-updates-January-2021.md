Maczko Chiropody & Orthotic Centre  is open and welcoming new and existing patients into our office for professional foot health assessments and treatments, as per regulations from the Ministry of Health of Ontario and the College of Chiropodists of Ontario.

As determined by Lambton Public Health and our governing college, masks are now optional by both staff and patients. If you request staff to wear a mask prior to treatment, please let us know when booking your appointment! 

If you are a confirmed carrier of the COVID-19 virus or show any symptoms of respiratory illness, you must self-quarantine as directed by Lambton Public Health and are not eligible for professional foot care treatments. Please contact your physicians office immediately for advice and treatment options, or utilize the information listed below.
