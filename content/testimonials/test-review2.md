I have seen Dr Maczko for a diabetic  ulcer on my foot through his care and diligence he has kept me from blowups, uncontrollable infections and has allowed me to keep my foot and limb, and have prevented me from keeping the dr's and specialists in cashing in. The private care from this clinic excels in excellence, the best and I have visited The Toe Bro in Mississauga and a Chirodipist in London, which the Medical profession of Sarnia misdiagnosed, but Maczko's Clinic was accurate, professional and the best from all that I have been treated. For diabetics my message to you is; DON'T RELY ON THE  SARNIA MEDICAL DOCTORS GO TO DR. MACZKO'S CLINIC.
