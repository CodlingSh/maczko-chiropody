Everyone is friendly, professional, and easy to work with. I am especially impressed by Becki, the woman who was working at the front desk when I was in. Becki can clearly communicate with people on the phone, provided as many as possible choices for appointments, and somehow always remembers my name. Jaime is also great; he listens and provides all possible treatments to patients. I am also sure that the other doctor is great as well. Overall I am satisfied with their services. I often recommend this clinic to people who are having foot trouble.
