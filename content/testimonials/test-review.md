I have been a patient of Jamie's for many years.  He treatments allow me to continue an active lifestyle into my 80s.  His neat, clean, facilities are well organized.  Staff are polite and very helpful.  And, when he's off on vacation, his two young associates do excellent work.  I've recommended him to several of our friends; they're now recommending him to their friends.
